TEST DRIVEN UPDATES TO IMPROVE MY PRODUCTIVITY
----------------------------------------------
1. Get end to end lambda scripts running
2. Rename BFF to token-handler

SUNDAY: BLOG / MESSAGE
----------------------
Get blog updated early and say I am using the Curity design pattern.
Mention my own token handler that allows me to test expiry and do custom logging.
Delete most of my own stuff in this area.

CODE CONSOLIDATION
------------------
1. Different cookie paths

2. Put back https://github.com/ebourmalo/cookie-encrypter
   Compare to main branch

3. Use token handler and not BFF
   Currently I use company-name-appname

4. Error responses are poor:
   - Code should be written to API logs
   - If server code exists it should overwrite the client code in the queryable data
   - Simple responses should be returned to the client

MILESTONES
----------
1. Blog message

2. Get cloud deployment working and code updated
   Also ensure that blog instructions are correct

3. Get this project working well on a developer PC
   Web developers should only need to use gateway routing and nothing else
   Update defaults in line with this
   Think more about my own setup also

4. Merge completed
