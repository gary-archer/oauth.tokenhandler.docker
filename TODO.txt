1. Deploy to AWS

2. curl requests and capture logs from Cloudwatch

3. Develop and test locally and continue deploying until operations all work - build up curl requests:
   completeLogin
   refreshAccessToken
   getAccessToken
   expireRefreshToken
   expireAuthCookie

4. Write a new anti forgery token after every refresh for better OWASP reviews
   But think about this from a multi tab browser viewpoint
   Are there any 401 race conditions that will cause SPA errors

5. Branch of SPA called feature/oauthwebproxy
   Remove oidc client completely
   Deployed as /spa2 with a different OAuth Client in AWS
   
6. SPA productive setup
   Node script to download and also run the proxy API when npm start is called

7. New SPA code to write
   Form the OpenID Connect URL
   Calculate the state and the PKCE details
   Add withCredentials to axios calls

8. New API code to write
   Validate id token and check AT hash - cf oidc client library
