TEST DRIVEN UPDATES TO IMPROVE MY PRODUCTIVITY
----------------------------------------------
1. Get end to end lambda scripts running

SUNDAY: BLOG / MESSAGE
----------------------
Get blog updated early and say I am using the Curity design pattern, linking to the SPA repo.
Mention my own token handler that allows me to test expiry and do custom logging.
Delete most of my own content in this area and use a very short page.

CODE CONSOLIDATION
------------------
1. Private cookie paths of /token-handler for state, ID and refresh tokens which never need to be sent to other paths.

2. Put back https://github.com/ebourmalo/cookie-encrypter from main branch
   See if encryption is compatible with Michal's
   If so then use the Curity BFF plugin and get rid of my extension

3. Error responses need improving:
   - Simpler client side error codes and error code checking, along with status 401 (SPA does not use invalid_grant)
   - More separated side error codes that are used for query purposes

MILESTONES
----------
1. Blog updated

2. SPA works locally with token handler API and plugin in Docker on port 444

3. Initial plan on updating APIs to port 446 and running Token Handler API on port 445

4. Cloud system updated and blog instructions still work

5. Code merged
