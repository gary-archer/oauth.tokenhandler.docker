- Lambda executor is no longer relevant to all lambdas
  Have a think about responsibilities and naming
  Compare Express and Lambda processing
  
- Lambda configuration needs to call executor.initialize
  But that feels wrong

- Lambda configuration needs to handle startup errors
  Feels like an extra level of indirection may help
