CURRENT STATUS
--------------
I am sending access tokens to cloud system and correctly getting data
Next I need to complete flows and consolidate

SUNDAY
------
Get blog updated early and say I am using the Curity design pattern.
Mention my own token handler that allows me to test expiry and do custom logging.
Delete most of my own stuff in this area.

TEST DRIVEN UPDATES TO IMPROVE MY PRODUCTIVITY
----------------------------------------------
1. expire to read the payload and handle both type='access' and type='refresh'

2. Get expire working with the 2 methods

3. Get end to end scripts running

CONSOLIDATION
-------------
1. Put back https://github.com/ebourmalo/cookie-encrypter
   Compare to main branch

2. Use token handler and not BFF
   Currently I use company-name-appname
   Best options may require more thought
   Should originate from path called on - perhaps:
   - /dev
   - /prod

3. Error responses are poor:
   - Code should be written to API logs
   - If server code exists it should overwrite the client code in the queryable data
   - Simple responses should be returned to the client

MILESTONES
----------
1. Get this project working well on a developer PC
   Web developers should only need to use gateway routing and nothing else
   Update defaults in line with this
   Think more about my own setup also

2. Focus on cloud deployment
