GO LIVE
-------
1. Error handling and logs to write properly
   - Startup errors to log in standard JSON format
   - Lambda local to output to a file
   - Exception handler needs to receive a log entry
   - Log to schema and include client id

2. Separate API logs from client response on a developer PC
   Control via crossenv - see lambda edge for an example

3. Deployed system logs to Elastic Cloud

4. Get testLambdas.sh completed
   
5. Think about configuration, paths and multiple SPAs and vulnerabilities
   More work on giving the 3 service classes reduced configuration
   OAuthService to do more of the OAuth work

CONSOLIDATION
-------------
1. Validate id token and check AT hash - cf other libraries such as Duende

2. Get Kubernetes deployment working for the proxy API and test with Curity
   Remove Serverless dependencies
