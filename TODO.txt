CURITY BUG
----------
1. Bug in plugin:
   https://github.com/curityio/kong-bff-plugin/blob/master/plugin/access.lua#L104

SERVERLESS
----------
1. Needs to handle cookies with the same logic as the BFF Plugin
   If no token then process AT and CSRF cookies
   Consider a bash script to run lambdas

ERRORS
------
1. Make encryption and decryption fail and verify error logs
   Do this for both HTTP workflow and lambda workflows

2. Client should not need to read token handler error codes and should just deal with 401s
   Return 401s to the SPA and a generic unauthorized error code
   Ensure that BFF PLUGIN errors (code and message) are reported correctly by the SPA

3. API logs to handle separate error details for service and client
   Distinct codes in the service, single code for the client

MILESTONES
----------
1. Update cloud from branches, then test on Windows, then merge code
   Blog updated in a basic way, with deletion of junk, and sample instructions still working

2. Local APIs work in a good way
   Also the ability to run the Token Handler under development, on port 446

3. Lessons learned from WebSample1 / End-to-End / SPA revamp consolidated
   End to end Docker to get working again

CODE CONSOLIDATION
------------------
1. Deal with expire errors in the UI and clearing them once working again

2. Java and .Net Core final APIs to set credentials: true in their CORS options

3. package.json updates for latest Typescript, Serverless

4. Get rid of tunnel-agent, as for websample1.NEW and check HTTP proxy still works

BLOG
----
1. Refer to Curity for security solution
   Blog post theme should be productive developer setup techniques.

2. Landscape is either simpler setup via ASP.Net / Spring Boot but with many follow on issues.
   Cookies add a lot of complexity and Docker is the best you can do, though separation it tricky.
