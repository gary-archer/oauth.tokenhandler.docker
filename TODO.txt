FLOWS
-----
1. Need to send expire with an object of {"type":"access"}
   createPostWithCookiesRequest needs to support sending data as parameter 2

2. Get lambda flow completed

3. Get rid of -finalspa in cookie suffix and run both test workflows

4. Private cookie paths of /token-handler for state, ID and refresh tokens which never need to be sent to other paths.

5. Make encryption fail and decryption fail and verify error logs
   API 500s and API log output to handle better when running lambda tests
   Decide some future behaviour, then get rid of this in logEntry.setServerError:
   - console.error(this._data.errorData);

6. Use /token-handler in the SPA and get it basically working

CODE CONSOLIDATION
------------------

1. package.json updates for latest Typescript, Serverless

2. Error responses need improving, and perhaps borrow some ideas from bff-node-express:
   - Simpler client side error codes and error code checking, along with status 401 (SPA does not use invalid_grant)
   - More separated side error codes that are used for query purposes

SPA
---
Get this connected and working, and iron out issues
Update the automation to use the Token Handler API and to call Docker

MILESTONES
----------
1. SPA works locally with token handler API and plugin running in Docker on port 444
   Initial plan on updating APIs to port 446 and running Token Handler API on port 445

2. Serverless project updated to handle secure cookies, similar to a reverse proxy plugin
   Use a single lambda authorizer to reduce incompatibilities.

3. Cloud system updated and SPA redeployed from branch

4. Code merged for final SPA and token handler API, and repo renamed to oauth.tokenhandlerapi

5. Blog updated and sample instructions still work


BLOG
----
1. Get first part of blog updated and say I am using the Curity design pattern, linking to the SPA repo.
   Mention my own token handler that allows me to test expiry and do custom logging.
   Delete most of my own content in this area so that there is a very short page.

2. Perhaps write some stuff on logging and automation
   Think about the language, and perhaps use 'BFF API' as my own term differentiated from Curity

MINOR
-----
1. Get rid of tunnel-agent, as for websample1.NEW and check HTTP proxy still works
