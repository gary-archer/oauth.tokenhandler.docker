GO LIVE
-------
1. Get testLambdas.sh working

2. Think about configuration, paths and multiple SPAs
   More work on giving the 3 service classes reduced configuration
   Are there extra vulnerabilities with multiple SPAs on the same domain?

3. Add logging middleware and log to the Elastic Search schema
   Logging also needs to use abstract request and response objects
   Must work for lambda and Express
   Deployed system writes to Elastic Cloud

CONSOLIDATION
-------------
1. Validate id token and check AT hash - cf other libraries such as Duende

2. Get Kubernetes deployment working for the proxy API and test with Curity
   Remove Serverless dependencies
