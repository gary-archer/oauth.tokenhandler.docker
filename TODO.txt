API REVAMP PART 1
-----------------
1. Get OAuth code grant working with lambda request objects
   Get cookie writing properly
   Add multi value headers to test data
   Fix current problem

2. Work out a test approach
   Generic API to think about
   Can client id securely be part of messages - probably not?

3. Deploy to AWS and add curl commands for testing

4. Implement for Express and see code in webhost of Final SPA

5. Add a getTokens operation to return access + id_token after login or on page load / new browser tab

6. Run the Duende code sample and understand messages + code
 
7. Add CORS middleware to API and write allow-credentials in response
   Also add logging middleware

8. Update README

API REVAMP PART 2
----------------
1. Validate id token and check AT hash - cf oidc client library

2. Write a new anti forgery token after every refresh for better OWASP reviews
   Rename CSRF to anti forgery
   Test this from a multi tab browser viewpoint
   Are there any 401 race conditions that the SPA cannot handle?

3. Proper API logging and write to Elastic Search from AWS
   Logging also needs to use abstract request and response objects

SPA REVAMP PART 1
-----------------
1. Branch of oauth.websample.final, with web reverse proxy and oidc client removed
   Check in with very clean code and a new authenticator implementation
   Only strategies are web and mobile
   Throw not implemented errors for operations that OIDC client implemented previously

2. Get OAuth redirects and session storage working
   Calculate the state and the PKCE details - cf oidc client and other libraries - or Auth0 web site

3. Update existing web oauth proxy client to do more work and be explicit, adding these methods
   Call them from the authenticator implementation:
   - Authorization Code Grant
   - Refresh Token Grant

4. Get CORS and sending of credentials working locally with Express
   Add withCredentials to axios calls
   Test cookies on all 4 browsers including Incognito
   Verify that a different port for API causes no problems

5. Deploy to cloud and verify that it works

6. Update README and mention back end for front end
   Then merge to master

SPA REVAMP PART 2
-----------------
1. Use acr_values
