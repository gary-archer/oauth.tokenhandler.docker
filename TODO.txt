API REVAMP PART 1
-----------------
1. Run the Duende code sample and understand messages + code

2. Additional operations
   Calculate login and logout URLs server side
   Store refresh token in auth_cookie and id token in id_cookie
   Update the anti forgery token on every refresh

3. Implement the same logic for Express and use code from webhost in Final SPA
   Add testHttpLocal.sh
 
4. SPA branch to verify cookie sending and CORS when an Expire button is clicked
   Add CORS middleware to API and write allow-credentials in response
   Add an OPTIONS request to curl tests

5. Add logging middleware and log to the Elastic Search schema

6. Detailed error testing

7. Update README

API REVAMP PART 2
----------------
1. Validate id token and check AT hash - cf oidc client library

2. Write a new anti forgery token after every refresh for better OWASP reviews
   Test this from a multi tab browser viewpoint
   Are there any 401 race conditions that the SPA cannot handle?

3. Proper API logging and write to Elastic Search from AWS
   Logging also needs to use abstract request and response objects

SPA REVAMP PART 1
-----------------
1. Branch of oauth.websample.final, with web reverse proxy and oidc client removed
   Check in with very clean code and a new authenticator implementation
   Only strategies are web and mobile
   Start by throwing not implemented errors for operations that OIDC client implemented previously

2. Get OAuth redirects and responses working, including error responses
   Store state between requests in sesson storage

3. Update existing web oauth proxy client to do more Axios work and be explicit, adding these methods
   Call them from the authenticator implementation:
   - Authorization Code Grant
   - Refresh Token Grant

4. Get CORS and sending of credentials working locally with Express
   Add withCredentials to axios calls
   Test cookies on all 4 browsers including Incognito
   Verify that a different port for API causes no problems

5. Deploy to cloud and verify that it works

6. Update README and mention back end for front end
   Then merge to master

SPA REVAMP PART 2
-----------------
1. Use acr_values
