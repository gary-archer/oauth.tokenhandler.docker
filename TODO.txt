API PHASE 1
-----------
1. API request / response data should use camel case fields
   Update API, SPA and bash script

2. AWS deployment with no Express dependencies
   Get rid of tunnel agent dependency also similar to main Serverless sample
   Then test via HTTP script

OAUTH FINALIZATION
------------------
1. Update READMEs

2. Think about configuration, paths and multiple SPAs
   Are there vulnerabilities here?
   More work on giving the 3 service classes reduced configuration - eg only entry point uses the host configuration

3. Validate id token and check AT hash - cf oidc client library

4. Get Kubernetes deployment working for the proxy API and test with Curity
   Remove Serverless dependencies

CONSOLIDATION
-------------
1. Test strategy to ensure Serverless working on a developer PC
   Ideally I want to run bash scripts and test all at once, but also have options to test individually
   Consider options between 'sls invoke', bash and NodeJS code and perhaps mix them up to build modular tests

2. Add logging middleware and log to the Elastic Search schema
   Logging also needs to use abstract request and response objects
   Data queryable in Elastic Cloud

3. Use authsamples.local instead of mycompany.com
   Tidy up acr_values and implement a Cognito strategy
